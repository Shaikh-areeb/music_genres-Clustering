# 🎵 Music Genre Clustering with Unsupervised Learning

## 📌 About
This project applies **unsupervised learning techniques** to group songs based on their audio features (e.g., tempo, loudness, danceability, energy, etc.). 
Using **K-Means clustering** (and other clustering algorithms), the model discovers hidden patterns in music data and organizes tracks into distinct genres **without prior labels**.

## 🚀 Features
- Data preprocessing and feature scaling for audio attributes  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** for understanding trends in music features  
- Statistical summary of key audio metrics  
- Clustering using **K-Means** and experimentation with other algorithms  
- Visualizations of clusters  
- Insights into similarities and differences between songs  
- Genre discovery without labeled data

## 📊 Workflow
1. **Data Collection** – Songs and their audio features (tempo, energy, danceability, loudness, etc.)  
2. **Data Preprocessing** – Cleaning, handling missing values, scaling numeric features  
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** –  
   - Distribution plots of audio features  
   - Correlation heatmaps between variables  
   - Outlier detection and handling  
4. **Statistical Summary** –  
   - Mean, median, standard deviation of features  
   - Feature-wise comparison across clusters  
   - Variance explained by principal components  
5. **Clustering** – Applying K-Means and tuning hyperparameters (Elbow Method, Silhouette Score)  
6. **Data Visualization** –  
   - scatter plots of clusters  
   - Cluster-wise centroid visualization  
7. **Evaluation** – Measuring clustering quality and interpretability  
8. **Results & Insights** – Understanding how clusters align with music genres and moods
